A reactive extension to generate URL previews.

This library parses available open graph data from the provided url and returns them as a simple model class. Otherwise, the library searches for other fallbacks and returns them instead.

Image dimensions are read from its uri by fetching the required bytes and then sorted according to their resolution.

## Gradle dependency
To use the library, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`
```groovy
dependencies {
	compile 'com.schinizer:rxunfurl:0.1.1'
}
```

## Usage
To generate previews, simply subscribe to `RxUnfurl.generatePreview(yourURL)`.

If you are on android, you will need `RxAndroid` to subscribe to network calls on another thread.
```Java
RxUnfurl.generatePreview("http://9gag.com")
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new Action1<PreviewData>() {
        @Override
        public void call(PreviewData previewData) {
           
        }
    }, new Action1<Throwable>() {
        @Override
        public void call(Throwable throwable) {
	
        }
    });
```
This library uses okhttp for network calls. If you will like to supply your instance, call:
```Java
RxUnfurl.setInternalClient(yourOKhttpClient);
```

## Sample App
